# Challenges

**Use Git to make a commit every time you get an answer working. Use sensible commit messages.**

- Work your way through the notes to get the API up and running with Laravel

---

## Tricksy

Create a new Laravel project called `library`. Build an API with the following spec and test each route with Postman. **Make sure you run `vagrant halt` on your blog API before running `vagrant up` on the new project, otherwise your requests might go to the wrong API.**

### `POST /books`

Creates a new "book" with the following attributes:

- `title`: the book title
- `pages`: the number of pages
- `published`: the date the book was published
- `ISBN`: the book's ISBN
- `rating`: a number between 1 and 5

Should return the newly added book in JSON format.

### `GET /books`

Returns a list of all the books in JSON format.

### `PUT /books/{book}`

Updates the given book and returns the updated book in JSON format.

### `DELETE /books/{book}`

Removes the given book.
