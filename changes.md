    * [ ] Add to challenge
    * [ ] Change wording on Tricksy challenge 01/02
- Mention no point have private methods in interfaces
- Better static property example?
- More easy challengs for first two days
    * [ ] Classes
    * [ ] Namespaces/Composer
    * [ ] OOP
- Mention use partial namespace with `use` - e.g. `App\Cutlery` so you can then do `new Cutlerty\Spoon()`
- Update 01/02 Books namespace to Library
    * [ ] Update 01/02 to use Library instead of Books
    * [ ] Update 02/01 challenge wording to remove moving namespace instructions
- Make it clear Interfaces are type-hints too
- Talk about `unsigned()` integers in foreign key stuff
- Mention `migrate:refresh` and `migrate:fresh`
